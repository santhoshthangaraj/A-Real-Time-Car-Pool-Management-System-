# A-Real-Time-Car-Pool-Management-System -
Project Overview:

A Real Time Car Pool Management System Android App - Providing car pool service to the two different kinds of users – ‘The Car Owner’ and ‘The Hitchhiker’. 

Car Owner:
The Car Owner will proceed by registering  along with certain details of his car like route, timings, car type, etc. and  route for the trip. 
Once registered, the car owner will be visible on map to other registered users on the system.
Car owner can track the hitchhiker registered for that particular car (until the trip start time).
Car owner can update/cancel the route and email notification will be sent to hitchhiker who all registered for that trip.

Hitchhiker:
If Hitchhiker is looking for car pool, person will choose their preferred route and all the cars on the route will be displayed to them. 
Hitchhiker can select a car and check if vacancy is there. If vacancy is there, Hitchhiker will register for that ride and a token will be given to them. 
Hitchhiker can track the registered  car(until the trip start time).
Hitchhiker will get notification if car owner cancel the trip.
A token will be generated which the Hitchhiker shows to car owner while getting in car.
For quickly getting the token, hitchhiker can search/type the car number in the system and register for that car.
Hitchhiker can cancel the trip

Token:
Token Generation feature is specifically going to be an authenticity measure of the hitchhiker as well as a safety measure for not only the car owner but also the co-hitchhikers in the car.
